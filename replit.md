- **Added Helper Methods**: Added convenient getter methods to EmojiManager: `getSuccess()`, `getError()`, `getWarning()`, `getInfo()`, `getLoading()`
- **Replaced Hardcoded Emojis**: Updated `gwin` command to use emojis from `emojis.json` instead of hardcoded custom emoji IDs

### Web Dashboard (Optional)
- **Express.js**: Web server framework with EJS templates, `express-session` for session management with MongoDB store, and Discord OAuth2 for authentication, providing a web-based configuration interface.

### Handlers & Middleware
- **Centralized Handlers**: For events, commands, interactions, presence updates, counter channels, reaction roles, stats, and greetings.

### Caching Strategy
- **Configurable Cache Sizes**: Separate limits for guilds, users, members, invites, cooldowns, and antispam.

- **Interactive Components**: Action rows with buttons/select menus are positioned below containers.
- **Design Patterns**: Clean containers, markdown headers, emoji integration, and color-coded accent bars (Blue for info, Green for success, Red for error, Yellow for warning).
- **ModernEmbed Fallback**: Maintained for commands not yet migrated to Components V2.
- **No ASCII Decorations**: Replaced with native Discord markdown and component layouts.
