# PFP Command Fix Summary

## Issue
The `!pfp` command was not responding in Discord.

## Root Cause
The pfp command was failing to load due to a **naming conflict**. The command had an alias `"avatar"` which was already registered by another command in the INFORMATION category.

### Error Message
```
ERROR: Failed to load /home/runner/workspace/src/commands/pfp/pfp.js 
Reason: Alias avatar already registered
```

## Solution
Removed the conflicting `"avatar"` alias from the pfp command's alias list.

### Changed in: `src/commands/pfp/pfp.js`
**Before:**
```javascript
aliases: ["pinterest", "avatar", "banner"],
```

**After:**
```javascript
aliases: ["pinterest", "banner"],
```

## Available Commands
The pfp command can now be used with:
- `!pfp <query>` - Main command
- `!pinterest <query>` - Alias
- `!banner <query>` - Alias

## Testing
✅ Command loads successfully  
✅ Bot restarts without errors  
✅ All aliases work correctly  

## Date Fixed
October 15, 2025
