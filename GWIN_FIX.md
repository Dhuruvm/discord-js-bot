# GWIN Command Fix - Preset Winners Now Work 100%

## Problem
The `gwin` command was setting preset winners successfully, but when giveaways ended, those preset winners were not actually winning. The winners were being chosen randomly instead of guaranteeing the preset winners would win.

## Root Cause
The giveaway handler in `src/handlers/giveaway.js` was only overriding the `_getWinners()` method, but the discord-giveaways library (v6.0.1) primarily uses the `_pickWinners()` method for selecting winners when a giveaway ends.

## Solution
Added a `_pickWinners()` method override to the `MongooseGiveaways` class in `src/handlers/giveaway.js`. This method:

1. **Retrieves preset winners** from `giveaway.extraData.presetWinners`
2. **Fetches and validates** each preset winner (ensures they're guild members and not bots)
3. **Guarantees preset winners** are included in the final winner list (up to the winner count)
4. **Fills remaining slots** with random winners if needed
5. **Prevents duplicates** between preset and random winners
6. **Returns exactly** the number of winners requested

## How It Works Now

### Setting Preset Winners
```
/gwin add <message_id> @user
```
- Adds the user to the giveaway's preset winners list
- Stores in database as `extraData.presetWinners[]`
- Can add multiple users (up to the winner count)

### When Giveaway Ends
1. System calls `_pickWinners()` method
2. Method loads preset winners from database
3. Preset winners are **guaranteed** to be in the winner list
4. If more winners are needed, random participants are selected
5. Final winner announcement includes preset winners

### Example Scenarios

**Scenario 1: All Preset Winners**
- Giveaway has 3 winner slots
- You set 3 users with `gwin add`
- **Result:** All 3 preset users win (no random selection)

**Scenario 2: Mixed Winners**
- Giveaway has 5 winner slots
- You set 2 users with `gwin add`
- **Result:** 2 preset users win + 3 random winners

**Scenario 3: Excess Preset Winners**
- Giveaway has 3 winner slots
- You set 5 users with `gwin add`
- **Result:** First 3 preset users win (in order added)

## Technical Details

### Modified File
- `src/handlers/giveaway.js`

### New Method Added
- `_pickWinners(giveaway)` - Primary winner selection method override

### Existing Method
- `_getWinners(giveaway, winnersCount)` - Kept for backwards compatibility

### Data Storage
- Preset winners stored in: `giveaway.extraData.presetWinners[]`
- Persisted to MongoDB via the Giveaways schema
- Available across bot restarts

## Testing Checklist

✅ Start a giveaway with `/giveaway start`
✅ Add preset winners with `/gwin add <message_id> @user`
✅ Verify preset winners are added with `/gwin list <message_id>`
✅ End the giveaway (manually or let it expire)
✅ Confirm preset winners are in the winner list
✅ Test with multiple scenarios (all preset, mixed, excess)

## Commands Reference

- `/gwin add <message_id> @user` - Add a preset winner
- `/gwin remove <message_id> @user` - Remove a preset winner
- `/gwin list <message_id>` - List all preset winners
- `!gwin add <message_id> @user` - (Prefix version)
- `!gwin remove <message_id> @user` - (Prefix version)
- `!gwin list <message_id>` - (Prefix version)

## Notes

- Preset winners must be guild members (not bots)
- Preset winners are prioritized in the winner list
- Works with both slash commands and prefix commands
- Changes are automatically saved to the database
- Cannot modify preset winners for ended giveaways

**Status:** ✅ Fixed and tested - Preset winners now work 100%
